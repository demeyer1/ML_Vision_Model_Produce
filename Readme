This is a sample transfer learning (ML) model designed to identify different types of produce, 
that are visually similar but have different names. 

For example, broccoli and chinese broccoli (Gai Lan). This is a confusing experience for checkout cashiers
who are sometimes unable to speak the native language of the individual purchasing the produce. 

This model has been trained to identify the differences between just one of these pairs, to determine the min 
labeled training set (~200 images) needed to function in a real world scenario. 

To use, extra the compressed files, and master CSV, and upload to Google Cloud Vision Auto ML.
